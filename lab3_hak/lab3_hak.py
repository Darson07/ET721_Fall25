# Conditional Statements
print('\n ----- Example #1: if, elif,..., else -----')
# Guess a number between 1 and 9
GUESS_NUM = 8
# Collect the number
user_num = int(input('Guess a number: '))
# Compare
if user_num == GUESS_NUM:
    print(f'Great job! {user_num} is the guess number')
elif user_num > GUESS_NUM:
    print(f'{user_num} should be lower')
elif user_num < GUESS_NUM:
    print(f'{user_num} should be higher')
else:
    print(f'ERROR!')

print('End of guessing!')



print('\n ----- Example #2: Control Flow with Logical Operators -----')
# 'and', 'or', 'not' operators
# 'and' operator returns TRUE ONLY if all statements are true
# 'or' operator returns TRUE if at least ONE of the statements are true
# 'not' operator returns the inverse of the statements. Ex. True ---> not operator ---> false
'''
Example #2: 
- Children from 5 to 9 are only given milk for breakfast
- Children from 10 to 14 are given sandwiches
- Children from 15 to 17 are given a burger
'''
age_student = int(input('Enter an age: '))
lunch = 'None'
if age_student <= 9 and age_student >= 5:
    lunch = 'milk'
elif age_student >= 10 and age_student <= 14:
    lunch = 'sandwich'
elif age_student >= 15 and age_student <= 17:
    lunch = 'burger'
else:
    lunch = 'None'

print(f'At age {age_student} the food is {lunch}')



print('\n ----- Example #3: For Loops as a Counter -----')
# 'for' loops enables the program to eexecutre a code block multiple times
for n in range(2,10):
    print(n)



print('\n ----- Example #4: For Loops in a List -----')
years = [2011,2005,1998,1980,1973]
for y in years:
    print(y)

for index in range(len(years)):
    print(f'Year {index+1} = {years[index]}')



print('\n ----- Example #5: While Loop as a Counter -----')
count = 1
while count <=5:
    print(count)
    count += 1



print('\n ----- Example #6: While Loop to Validate a Number -----')
# Validate If a Number is Between -5 and 5 (Inclusive)
num = int(input('Enter a number between -5 and 5: '))
# Use a while loop to recollect if the num is not between -5 and 5
while num < -5 or num > 5:
    num = int(input('ERROR! Enter a number between -5 and 5: '))

print(f'Entered number = {num}')



print('\n ----- Modify Example #1 -----')
'''
Modify Example #1:
- Use while loop to validate if the user number is between 1 and 9
- User can only guess three times. This can be done using a for loop or a while loop
