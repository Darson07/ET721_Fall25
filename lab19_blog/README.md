This is a basic blog program using Django. It allows users to create, view, and edit blog posts. It starts with setting up the project and the app by installing the virtual environment, then installing Django within that environment. Then, using Django, start the "blogproject" project and the "blog" app. To make sure the app runs, the blog app needs to be added into "INSTALLED_APPS" in the blogproject settings.py file. That was part 1. Part 2 involves creating the model for blog posts in the blog/models.py file, then running migrations. Part 3 is all about creating the views and URL patterns in the blog/views.py file, then linking the url patterns between blog/urls.py and blogproject/urls.py. Part 4 is all about creating the HTML files in blog/templates/blog so that the user can actually create, view, and edit the blogs. Part 5 is about creating the form for each blog post. Finally, is some basic CSS styling to make everything look nice.
